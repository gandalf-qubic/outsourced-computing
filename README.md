# Qubic Outsourced Computing

Find information about outsourced computing in Qubic.

## Base Concept
In Qubic the power brung by the AI Trainers (Miners) can be used to support different projects.

Currently 50% of the time is allocated to Aigarth. The other 50% are used individually.


## Monero POC
To demonstrate the capability on how the second 50% can be used. Qubic will run a POC (Prove of concept) with integrating Monero mining into Qubic.

Please find the POC description in [Monero POC](monero-poc/README.md).
